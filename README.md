# gyroscope
Required Edits: 
1. check settling time - throwing up NaN unexpectedly 
2. uncertainty - implemented. 
3. LQG - implemented. figure out how to tune Q, R and how to figure out covariance matrices. figure out how to quantify variation due to noise
4. comment 
5. label state plots correctly and plot data collected 
6. make modules for uncertainty, noise, varying initial condition etc to allow for simulating all conditions
